          Hello, and welcome to the Mainframe. My name is Angel, and I will be
          your guide through this long journey filled with 1s and 0s as we race

            I am a determined self-taught web developer and full-stack
            development student with a strong passion for software security and
            open-source technologies. My journey into technology began with a
            desire to expand my career opportunities and make a meaningful
            impact in the field of software engineering. With seven years of
            experience as a Spanish Interpreter at Atrium Health, I have
            developed exceptional communication, analytical, and problem-solving
            skillsâ€”qualities that seamlessly translate into my work in tech. My
            background in healthcare has given me a unique perspective on
            user-centric solutions, inspiring me to create software that is both
            functional and accessible.
            <br />
            <br />
            Balancing a full-time job with my studies, I demonstrate discipline
            and perseverance, continuously pushing myself to learn new
            programming languages, frameworks, and tools. Focused on building a
            career in IT, I am currently preparing for a transition into
            technical support and administrative roles within the healthcare
            system, leveraging my existing expertise while strengthening my
            technical foundation. My journey reflects a commitment to growth,
            adaptability, and excellence as I work toward building a successful
            career in technology.
